Analyzed the Data performing ETL , DATA CLEANING ,EDA and VISUALIZATIONS in jupyter notebook implementing python libraries . Hi All 👋🏻!

Excited to Share my Zomato Data Analysis Using Python 🚀

•Libraries Used:🎯

1.Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis, including reading and cleaning the dataset.

2.Numpy: For numerical operations, such as handling missing values and data type conversions.

3.Matplotlib and seaborn: For creating visualizations and plots to understand trends in the data.

•Steps

1.Data Loading: Imported the dataset using pandas with pd.read_csv() and examined the initial structure of the data.

•Data Cleaning:🎯

1.Removed unnecessary columns like 'url', 'address', 'phone', and 'reviews_list'.

2.Dropped duplicates and handled missing values in critical columns like 'rate', replacing them with the column's mean.

3.Cleaned specific columns such as converting 'rate' values from strings to floats and handling inconsistent formats in the 'Cost2plates' column.

•Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):🎯

1.Checked the shape and column data types of the DataFrame.

2.Identified unique values in key columns to understand the distribution of data, such as restaurant types and locations.

•Visualizations:🎯

1.Utilized matplotlib and seaborn to create graphs and plots that showcase trends, distributions, and relationships within the data.
